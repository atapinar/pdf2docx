PDF to DOCX Conversion Using Python

This guide explains how to convert a PDF file to a DOCX format using Python. We’ll use the pdf2docx library for this task.
Prerequisites

    Python installed on your system.
    Visual Studio Code (VSCode) or any Python-compatible code editor.
    A PDF file that you want to convert.

Steps

    Clone the Repository (Optional): If you are working with a GitHub repository, clone it to your local machine:

    bash

git clone <your-repo-url>

Install the Required Python Package: Open a terminal in VSCode and install the pdf2docx package:

bash

pip install pdf2docx

Create a Python Script: Create a new file in the project folder and save it as pdf_to_docx_converter.py. Then, paste the following code into the file:

python

from pdf2docx import Converter

pdf_file = 'clcoding.pdf'  # Your PDF file name
docx_file = 'clcoding.docx'  # Output DOCX file name

cv = Converter(pdf_file)
cv.convert(docx_file)
cv.close()

Add Your PDF File: Make sure the PDF file you want to convert (e.g., clcoding.pdf) is in the same directory as your Python script:

bash

/your-project-folder
  ├── pdf_to_docx_converter.py
  └── clcoding.pdf

Run the Code: In the terminal, navigate to the directory where your Python script is located and run:

bash

    python pdf_to_docx_converter.py

    Check the Output: A DOCX file should be created in the same folder, named clcoding.docx.

Troubleshooting

    If you get a ModuleNotFoundError, ensure you've installed the pdf2docx library using the command:

    bash

pip install pdf2docx

If your PDF is located in a different directory, provide the full path to the PDF in the code:

python

    pdf_file = 'C:/full/path/to/your/clcoding.pdf'

Additional Notes

    Consider using a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

    bash

python -m venv venv

Then activate it using:

    Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
